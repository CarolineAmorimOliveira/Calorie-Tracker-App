# Calorie Counter & Player Dictionary

This project is a simple Python program created as part of my Valencia College Dual Enrollment coursework.
It introduces basic Python concepts by combining a calorie counter with a dictionary exploration.

## Description

The program allows the user to:
- Enter their name and receive a personalized greeting.
- See the recommended daily calorie intake (based on Cleveland Clinic guidelines).
- Input the number of calories consumed so far and calculate the remaining calories for the day.
- Explore Python dictionaries by storing and retrieving famous soccer players' jersey numbers.

## Concepts Covered

- User input and string concatenation
- Type casting (`int`)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Printing and checking variable data types with `type()`
- Using Python dictionaries to store and access data
